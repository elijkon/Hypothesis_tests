# Hypothesis_tests
Chance Model I want to see if males are more extraverted than females and others. I want my significance level to be 0.05.  Null Hypothesis: There is no difference in extraversion betweeen males and females/others.  
Alternative Hypothesis: Males have higher extraversion scores than females and others.

Permutation Test
We want to know if the average age in the "Agreeable" group is significantly different than in the "Disagreeable" group. The significance level is 0.05.
Null Hyppothesis: The average age in the "Agreeable" group is the same as in the "Disagreeable" group.
Alternative Hypothesis: The average age in the "Agreeable" group is less than the average age in the "Disagreeable" group.
I am testing if Agreeable people are younger.

Bootstrap
We want to estimate the mean Neuroticism in males. To do this we will bootstrap a 95% confidence interval.
Finally, we will ask if the mean Neuroticism of females falls inside the confidence region and is therefore similar to the Neurocitism of males or not.
Null Hypothesis: The mean Neuroticism in males is the same as the Neuroticismin mean in females.
Alternative Hypothesis: The mean Neuroticism in males is different from the mean Neuroticism in females.
